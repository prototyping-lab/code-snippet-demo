Demo of how to collect snippets for the iot code library

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

## Features

- results left, snippets right
- add snippets
- remove snippets
- change collection title
- confetti :)

## Versions

- v1: HTML + CSS + JS
    - construct collection from HTML

- v2: HTML + CSS + JS + Query-Params
    - use query params to encode a collection
    - save collection link to the clipboard
    - read collection from a link

## TODO

- right now it's just a quick hack using vanilla javascript
- use a model-view based framework such as vue.js
- validate collection using a hash, so we don't get incomplete collections
